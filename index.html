                <li>Are architects designers or engineers? They are actually both. Architecture includes all of these where they both design and engineer to make the best architecture.</li>
                <li>At a young age, I think that architects are people that build the dream houses for other people. And now, I would like to study more the discipline of architecture to help me learn more.</li>

              <h2>Portable Designer</h2>
              <h3>Overview/Content</h3>
              <p>Many architecture designs on computers.  But what if they have to travel. I was having
              this idea as a tape measure, where the ruler can be pulled out so when connecting to the
              technology, we can design it into when pressing a button, the screen will be able to be move
              /go back. Architecture is also designing and making blueprints on paper, but if they lose it
              and use too much paper, it is bad for the environment. But what happens if they need to
              travel, they won’t be able to bring a whole computer with them. So let's see my idea.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>So I was thinking, if we can make a portable and foldable/roll up technology, it would be much easier and design everywhere they want.</li>
                  <li>They can open/pull out an electronic scroll and start designing and pull the pen out of the side corner.</li>
                  <li>It will be waterproof, so the architecture will be able to be not worried about the design getting wet like how in paper</li>
                  <li></li>
              </ul>
